# 📧 Email Payment Links Setup Guide

## Overview

The EMI VoiceBot can send real payment links via email using Gmail SMTP. This demonstrates production-ready functionality where customers receive secure payment links directly in their inbox.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Gmail App Password Setup

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** (required)
3. Go to **App passwords** section
4. Select **Mail** as the app
5. Copy the 16-character app password

### 2. Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file:

```bash
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### 3. Test Email Functionality

```bash
# Start the server
python advanced_ui_server.py

# Test email sending via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/payment/send-link" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "session_id": "test"}'
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Voice Demo Integration

1. **Customer says**: "Send me the payment link"
2. **AI responds**: "I'll send you a payment link. What's your email?"
3. **Customer provides**: "my email is john@example.com"
4. **AI automatically**: Sends payment link and confirms

### Email Content

The payment email includes:

- 💳 **Secure Payment Button**
- 📋 **Payment Details** (Amount, Due Date, Payment ID)
- 🔗 **Demo Payment Link** (with demo notice)
- 📞 **Alternative Payment Methods**
- ✅ **Professional Formatting**

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/payment/send-link` - Send payment link
- `GET /api/payment/sent-links` - Track sent emails

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Production Ready

- **SSL/TLS Encryption** for email transmission
- **Unique Payment IDs** for each transaction
- **Email Validation** and error handling
- **Rate Limiting** (can be added)

### Demo Safeguards

- Clear **"Demo Notice"** in emails
- **Non-functional payment links** (safe for testing)
- **Tracking system** for sent emails

## 📱 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Voice Request

```
User: "I want to pay my EMI"
AI: "I can send you a secure payment link. What's your email?"
User: "Send it to john.doe@example.com"
AI: "✅ Payment link sent to john.doe@example.com!"
```

### Scenario 2: Immediate Email

```
User: "Send payment link to sarah@company.com"
AI: "✅ Done! Payment link sent to sarah@company.com"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication failed"**

   - Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled
   - Use App Password, not regular Gmail password
   - Check email/password format

2. **"Email not sent"**

   - Verify internet connection
   - Check Gmail SMTP settings
   - Ensure recipient email is valid

3. **"Missing configuration"**
   - Check `.env` file exists
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Restart server after config changes

### Testing Without Gmail

```python
# For testing without real emails, the system will:
# 1. Generate payment links
# 2. Log email attempts
# 3. Return success/failure status
# 4. Track all attempts in memory
```
